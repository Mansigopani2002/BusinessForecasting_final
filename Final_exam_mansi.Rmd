#Please summarize your observations of the time series plot 
#The chart illustrates a time series with data_ts plotted over time. Initially, the values remain relatively stable with minor variations. Around mid-2023, there is a noticeable sharp drop, followed by a recovery that trends upward as it approaches 2024.

#Can you summarize your observation about the time series from the summary stats and box plot?
# The mean for the data is approximately 16.205 as shown in the summary output.  
# From the boxplot, the data values range from around 8.9 (minimum) to approximately 18 (maximum).  
# The interquartile range (IQR) spans from 16.352 (1st quartile) to 17.549 (3rd quartile).  
# There are outliers below the lower whisker, as seen around values less than 14.  
# The boxplot is not skewed; the data distribution is fairly symmetrical with the median close to the center of the box.

#Is the time series seasonal? 
#Yes the Time series is seasonal

#Is the decomposition additive or multiplicative?
#The decomposition appears to be additive, as the seasonality remains consistent and does not increase alongside the rising trend. This indicates that the seasonal component remains uniform throughout the time series.

#If seasonal, what are the values of the seasonal monthly indices?

#The plots indicate that the residuals are generally centered around zero, suggesting the model captures the overall trend reasonably well. However, the larger deviations in specific years, particularly 2023, highlight periods where the model struggled to accurately fit the data, possibly due to anomalies or significant changes in the underlying trend during that time.

#Do a plot of actual values vs. residuals. What does the plot indicate? 

plot(data_ts, naive_residual)

#The plot indicates that residuals are closer to zero for higher values of `data_ts`, suggesting a better model fit during those periods. However, significant deviations are seen for lower values, particularly in 2023, highlighting areas where the model underperforms.

#Do an ACF plot of the residuals? What does this plot indicate? 

Acf(naive_residual)

#The ACF plot of residuals shows most autocorrelations within the confidence bounds, indicating no significant correlation between residuals at different lags. This suggests that the model has captured the underlying structure of the data reasonably well.

plot(ses_fc$residuals)

#The SES model effectively captures the overall trend but encounters errors, particularly a sharp spike in 2023, highlighting a limitation in its ability to handle sudden changes. Although the model performs well in general, it struggles with abrupt shifts, indicating the potential need for more sophisticated models or a deeper analysis of the anomaly.


#Do a Histogram plot of residuals. What does the plot indicate? 
hist(ses_fc$residuals)

#The SES model delivers fairly accurate predictions, with most errors concentrated near zero. However, notable negative errors suggest that the model struggles with certain data patterns or anomalies. While its overall performance is adequate, it may fall short when dealing with unexpected fluctuations in the data.

#Do a plot of fitted values vs. residuals. What does the plot indicate? 

plot(ses_fc$fitted,ses_fc$residuals,xy.labels = FALSE,xy.lines = FALSE)

plot(ses_fc$fitted,ses_fc$residuals)

#Do a plot of actual values vs. residuals. What does the plot indicate? 
plot(data_ts,ses_fc$residuals)

#The plot reveals patterns in the residuals, indicating that the model fails to fully capture the underlying data structure. The residual variance is inconsistent (heteroscedasticity), reflecting unequal error dispersion. This highlights the need for model improvement or potential data transformation.

#Do an ACF plot of the residuals? What does this plot indicate?

plot(forecast(HW_fc))

#What is the value of alpha?  What does that value signify?
#The value of alpha is 0.0018.Alpha is the smoothing parameter for the level component. A low value of alpha indicates that the model gives more weight to past data and less weight to recent observations for estimating the level.

#What is the value of beta? What does that value signify?
#The value of beta is 0.0001.Beta is the smoothing parameter for the trend component. A very low beta suggests that the trend is stable over time and changes very slowly

#What is the value of gamma? What does that value signify?
#The value of gamma is 0.9982.Gamma is the smoothing parameter for the seasonal component. A high gamma value indicates that the seasonal component adapts quickly to changes in seasonality.

#What is the value of initial states for the level, trend, and seasonality? What do  these values signify?
#Initial state values:
#Level (l): 18.7948 Trend (b): -0.1993 Seasonality (s): Values in the list from 1.2512 to -2.0162.These values represent the starting points for the level, trend, and seasonal components used by the model for forecasting.

#What is the value of sigma?  What does the sigma signify?
#The value of sigma is 3.0971.Sigma represents the standard deviation of the residuals (errors). It quantifies the average deviation of observed values from the fitted model values. A smaller sigma indicates a better fit.

#Naive Forecast: This method predicts future values by assuming that the next observation will be the same as the most recent value. It is most effective for time series without a clear trend or seasonal pattern.
#SES (Simple Exponential Smoothing): This technique assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, giving more importance to recent data points. It is suitable for time series without trends or seasonality but where recent values are more influential.
#Holt-Winters (HW) Forecast: An advanced form of exponential smoothing that incorporates both trend and seasonal components. This method is ideal for time series data that exhibit consistent patterns over time, such as seasonal fluctuations.
#ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): A sophisticated model that combines autoregressive (AR) terms, differencing (I) to achieve stationarity, and moving average (MA) terms to model residuals. ARIMA is particularly useful for time series with complex patterns, including trends and seasonality.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
